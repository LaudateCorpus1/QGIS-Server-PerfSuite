<p>The aim of this test is to measure the response time of the server for the <i>GetCapabilities</i> request with <b>PostgreSQL view</b> and the <b>trust</b> option.</p>

<p>When the <b>trust</b> option is activated, the response time of the very first request should be much more lower.</p>

<p>Dataset:</p>

<ul>
  <li> 1 Point layer named <i>adress_ban_view</i> based on a PostgreSQL view (~ 14 000 features) with the <i>Categorized</i> renderer and without labels
</ul>
